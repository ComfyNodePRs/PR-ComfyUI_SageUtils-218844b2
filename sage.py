# A collection of utility nodes, many of which are dealing with metadata and collecting it.

# __init__.py is the entry point for the Sage Utils package. 
#  It contains the node definitions and the display names for the nodes. 
#  It also loads the cache and styles for the nodes. 

# It also imports this file, which imports the others.

# Any files with "nodes" in the name are node definitions.
