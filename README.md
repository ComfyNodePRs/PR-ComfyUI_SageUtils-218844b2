This is the Sage Utils set of custom nodes. Everyone seems to be making their own suites of nodes, and I decided I'd go ahead and make one myself, for any nodes I feel would be helpful.

I've started with a bunch of metadata nodes. There are several other node sets out there for adding metadata for interoperability with Civitai, but I wasn't happy with them and decided to try spinning my own, though I definitely looked at ImageSaver and other places.

Anything dealing with Lora Stacks is intended to be interoperable with other custom nodes that use those, though I'm also spinning my own versions of a few nodes so that you don't need to use other sets nodes with mine.
