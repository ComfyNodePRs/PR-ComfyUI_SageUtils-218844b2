If you are reading this, feel free to open an issue, as I should update this before changing this from private to public.

This is the Sage Utils set of custom nodes. Basically just where I'm going to be sticking all the nodes that I create for the moment.

I intend to make some nodes to help with managing metadata, first of all, as I'mn not really happy with the existing ones I've found. I'd also like to have some nodes for working with Civitai, and possibly image websites apis.
